A python script that creates a list of all lower-case letter combinations from a chosen maximum to 1. Useful to create password lists to brute-force weak passwords.

Example:
Choosing 2 would start the script creating "aa" then "ab" to "zz" to "a" to finally "z" with all other letter combinations inbetween.

The export file is named "LOG.txt" and is located in the same directory where the script was ran.

The script can be run with a maximum range from 1-6.

WARNING: Running the script with a chosen maximum of 6 will create a text file larger than 2gb! This may crash some computers and create a file too large to be opened by conventional text editors.
